# YouTube-analysis

Wrote a piece of code to connect to my Youtube account and analyses my historical views.
From this, I was able to see the past 6 years of historical data, regrouping all metadata on the videos I've watched.

I used this to understand:
- the topics I watched the most (Lifestyle, Entertainment, Food and Television program all had more than 1000 videos watched),
- the tags I watched the most (funny, comedy, vlog, buzzfeed, food and travel),
- the average amnount of videos / duration I watched per year, month, day of the week
- the channels I watched the most

Since then, I've stopped Youtube from collecting my historical data :)
